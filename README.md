#Coursera Assignment for Development on Data Products

## Introduction

This uses the Shiny server app from R, to show the CO2 emmissions based on the mark of the vehicle. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this is to make a CO2 emissions calculator per person including other factors as where you live, if you use natural gas for cooking and so on. So this little example is the first step into a more complex analysis. This little database was allocated from a friend called Hector Herrera at UPME, Bogotá, Colombia.
